# Bangla-Python-Converter <br>
Ever wanted to write python in bangla? I got your back xD <br>
Test.nup is the code in bangla. Then write python modify.py test.nup in console to convert. Finally write python runner.py to run the converted code. <br>
print = likho <br>
if = jodi <br>
elif = othoba <br>
else = nahoy <br>
while = jotokhonProjonto <br>
will work to update more in near future In Shaa Allah. <br>
Have fun. <br>
