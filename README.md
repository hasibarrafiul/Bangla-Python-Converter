# Bangla-Python-Converter <br>
Ever wanted to write python in bangla? I got your back xD <br>
test.py is the code in bangla. You can create your own file.py. Then write "python modify.py test.py" in console to convert. Finally write "python runner.py" to run the converted code. <br>
print = likho <br>
if = jodi <br>
elif = othoba <br>
else = nahoy <br>
while = jotokhonProjonto <br>
will work to update more in near future In Shaa Allah. <br>
Have fun. <br>
